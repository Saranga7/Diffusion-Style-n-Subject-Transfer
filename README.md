# Subject & Style Transfer using Diffusion Models

A pipeline that can take both a set of subject images and a style image for generating new images. For instance, "A picture of <subject> riding a horse on the moon, in the style of <style>". It is not required to following the prompting format from the examples provided here, i.e., the task does not have to be solved with a single prompt/model evaluation. Prompt following capabilities should be preserved as much as possible while incorporating subject and style. Feel free to be creative and incorporate your own ideas.
